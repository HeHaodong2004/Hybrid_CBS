# Hybrid CBS Project with RL and A*

This repository contains an implementation of a hybrid CBS (Conflict-Based Search) planner that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and A* as low-level planners. The project allows for both single-agent and multi-agent path planning, leveraging the strengths of different methods.

## 📂 Files

- **`RL_train.py`**  
  Train the RL planner (Rainbow DQN) for single-agent scenarios.

- **`RL_test.py`**  
  Test the performance of the trained RL planner in single-agent planning tasks.

- **`RL_CBS.py`**  
  Test the performance of the RL-integrated CBS framework in multi-agent scenarios, using RL as the low-level planner.

- **`CBS.py`**  
  Test CBS with flexible low-level planners (RL and A*), demonstrating the hybrid multi-agent planning capability.

- **`best_25.98.pth`**  
  Pre-trained model weights for the RL planner.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Train the RL Planner

```bash
python RL_train.py
```

### 2️⃣ Test Single-Agent RL Planning

```bash
python RL_test.py
```

### 3️⃣ Test Hybrid CBS with RL for Multi-Agent Planning

```bash
python RL_CBS.py
```

### 4️⃣ Test CBS with RL and A* for Multi-Agent Planning

```bash
python CBS.py
```

## 💡 Notes

- Make sure to have the required Python dependencies installed (e.g., `torch`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
- You can switch between different low-level planners (RL or A*) in `CBS.py` as needed.
- The repository also includes the pre-trained model (`best_25.98.pth`) for testing the RL planner.
- Feel free to modify the scripts for your own experiments or extend the project further!
